$5,000: DeFAI: Create intelligent DeFi agents that can execute onchain strategies autonomously using Brahma's ConsoleKit.

Sponsored by Brahma

What to build:
•⁠ ⁠An AI agent that makes intelligent DeFi decisions
•⁠ ⁠Custom strategy workflows for your agent
•⁠ ⁠Integration with ConsoleKit for secure execution

ConsoleKit provides the agent with:
•⁠ ⁠Interface for LLMs
•⁠ ⁠Dedicated Safe smart account with policy controls
•⁠ ⁠onchain action toolkit
•⁠ ⁠Secure transaction execution API
•⁠ ⁠Relayer infrastructure for settlement

Focus on building your agent's intelligence - ConsoleKit handles the execution.

Hard Requirements for Qualification:

Must use ConsoleKit for execution layer
Must implement custom AI/LLM decision-making logic
Must include a clear DeFi strategy
Must demonstrate autonomous operation capability
Must include security considerations and risk parameters

Leverage ConsoleKit to Build Projects Across 6 Agentathon Tracks!a

ConsoleKit provides the crucial bridge between AI intelligence and onchain execution. It combines Brahma's battle-tested security infrastructure with a flexible execution engine.
AI agents can now transition from analysis to action through secure smart accounts, protected by customizable policies and multiple safety checks.

Using ConsoleKit for the Brahma Hackathon Track
Brahma DeFAI ($5,000; 1st Place: $2,500, 2nd Place: $1,500, 3rd Place: $1,000)
Create an agent using ConsoleKit as execution layer, while implementing AI/LLM decision-making.
Agent examples include, but are not limited to:
Auto rebalancing between aaave, fluid and morpho based on APY and risk
Intelligent swapping in and out of tokens based on offchain data (pricing, volume, sentiment)
Managing a borrow position based on collateral price/risk
Maintaining same balances across chains / refueling

How to Use ConsoleKit
Example
CoW Protocol ($5,000; 1st Place: $2,500, 2nd Place: $1,500, 3rd Place: $1,000)
Use ConsoleKit's Tools for CoW Protocol integration; create workflows for order execution and monitoring; implement policy guardrails for trade limits; use scaffold-agent template
Build an Intelligent DCA agent on Cowswap: creates limit orders using workflows, adjusts size dynamically based on price/volume/liquidity, uses Coingecko API for price feeds
Arbitrum DeFi ($10,000; 1st Place: $5,000, 2nd Place: $3,000, 3rd Place: $2,000)
Use CoreActions like swap; create monitoring workflows for lending positions; implement trigger-based actions; reference scaffold-agent for setup
Monitor collateral and health factor on AAVE, automatically repay or add collateral; execute trigger-based swaps; move supplies between AAVE and Fluid for max yield
