## **What is StakeKit?**

StakeKit is the largest yield aggregator in Web3. Covering more than 1,000 yields, StakeKit supports native staking of assets across more than 70 networks as well as all major DeFi protocols. This includes lending products like Aave, Compound, and Fluid; structured products via Yearn and EtherFi; and LP positions on Pendle and beyond. Overall, protocols supported by StakeKit account for over 75% of DeFi TVL.

It allows users to seamlessly stack yields across LSTs, LRTs, lending pools, and DeFi structured products and provides full coverage of all incentive tokens and points distributed by networks and protocols.

On top of the Yield API which enables seamless integration of all available yields into your product, StakeKit users also get access to Blances & Metadata API — which offers multiple endpoints to retrieve an address balance, including yield-related balances and available token balances in addition to real-time information about each supported yield — APY, available validators, available actions, and more. in essence, all the metadata and functionalities needed to create a complete user-facing yield interface.
